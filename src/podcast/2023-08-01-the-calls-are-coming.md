imageAlt: Shirley Calls Are Coming From Inside The Podcast
description: April Fools Day may be over, but the month of the fool is still going strong. Our first round of horror-flavored laughs comes courtesy of some gateway horror films that made us and our guests fans for life. First, we talk with DeVaughn and Garrett of the Bloody Blunts Cinema Club podcast about that ghost with the most, Beetlejuice. And then we switch over to a man doing just as much, if not more, to talk about Ernest Scared Stupid with Shirley Blazen.
