  burlesque, clown, drag and variety performers as we take a trip back in time.
  Put on your platforms, feather your hair and enjoy this wild night of
  immersive disco-tech dreams with a DISCO DANCE PARTY to follow the
  show!  Specialty cocktails, intimate tables and a true speakeasy feel make
  this a memorable experience for date night, bachelorette parties, or a place
  shake away the Sunday scaries - we're a block from both NorthHalsted (formerly
  Boystown) and Wrigleyville! Within walking distance of the Addison Red Line,
  Belmont Brown Line, and off a Clark Street bus stop.  Bring your tipping
  dollars for an interactive night you'll never forget.  Pï»¿lease be
  advised:  Our venue is up a flight of stairs (no elevator, but there is a
  private entrance with a railing) and has two all-gender single-stall restrooms
  onsite. Email us with any accessibility/entry questions at
  newporttheater@gmail.com"
