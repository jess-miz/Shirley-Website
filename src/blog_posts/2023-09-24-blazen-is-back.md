🔥 SHIRLEY BLAZEN IS BACK! 🔥

 ❓“Where did they go this summer?” 

🗨️ in short: Day job > Chronic Pain > Vacation

🧀 The last show I did was the Fierce! fest, where I had the opportunity to perform alongside talent from across the country and teach a workshop: Cheesy Tease! A Slapstick-centric dance party. 

🧳🌞 Summer was also chock full of day job work travel with some leftover hours to soak up the Summertime sun.

🩹 My body has gone through many a-motions to heal from a 2022 car accident. 

💪 May-July: After a promising procedure, I returned to my old self, debuting a new act and organizing a return to teaching.

🤕 August: I was served a nasty pain flare-up, learning from the doctor that the “old self” I was feeling was not permanent, so more procedures are on the horizon.😿 Went through a stupid depressive episode cuz

BUT! that didn’t stop Blazen from:

👘🇯🇵 Enjoying the trip of a lifetime to Japan with @y2kane_ (fun photos to come!)

🎥🤡 Filming two Wild Clown House episodes

🎬 NOW that I’m more composed mentally & physically-ish, IT'S COMEBACK TIME!
