						<h3>Meet Shirley Blazen of Shirley Blazen The Oh So Amazin’ in Avondale</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Blazen’s adventure began where most art manifests, at the corner of curiosity and conflict. I was coming to terms with trauma, seeking a way to reaffirm my autonomy. I struggled with self-esteem and into my life came an ad for a burlesque class. After wrestling with my inner demons, I threw nerves into the wind, put my best heel forward and fell in love with Burlesque...</p>

						<h3>The Ladylike Project got mad, then gave back</h3>
					</header>
					<p>I think there’s always been a push for particularly women to express their anger in a way that is palatable for people, and I’m tired of that,” said Haag. She turned her anger into the Ladylike Project, a collective she created to connect artists who want to raise money for progressive causes—and she threw a big middle finger smack-dab in the center of an otherwise dainty logo to show that she’s not pulling any punches...</p>

						<h3>Review: Sixth Annual Nerd Comedy Fest Remains Full of Heart</h3>
					</header>
					<p>... this festival has always been an intimate favorite, truer to the nature of a gathering of the nerd variety than large commercial cons, and inextricably linked to the theater and comedy scene in Chicago in a way that make it unique to the city. Comedy was followed by burlesque, with Shirley Blazen, who we’d also see as emcee for Acrobatica Infiniti the next evening, provided My Little Pony’s “bronies” and gal pals with plenty of PG-13 thrills. Later on in the show, she made another appearance as beloved (?) Simpsons clown, Krusty, in a particularly story-driven piece of titillating performance art...</p>

						<p>April Fools Day may be over, but the month of the fool is still going strong. Our first round of horror-flavored laughs comes courtesy of some gateway horror films that made us and our guests fans for life. First, we talk with DeVaughn and Garrett of the Bloody Blunts Cinema Club podcast about that ghost with the most, Beetlejuice. And then we switch over to a man doing just as much, if not more, to talk about Ernest Scared Stupid with Shirley Blazen.</p>
